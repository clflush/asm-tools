                Instrument AT&T Syntax Assembler Files

Use asm-inst to instrument AT&T  syntax assembler files (such as those
produced by "gcc -S") to save  a trace of their execution.  Every code
label in  the assembler file is  instrumented to print it's  name to a
file named `trace.out' every time the label is executed.

    # Compile the program and view the code labels
    $ gcc -S w-func.c
    $ grep "^\.L[0-9]" w-func.s

    # Instrument the program
    $ ./asm-inst w-func.s >w-func.inst.s

    # Run the instrumented program and view executed labels
    $ gcc -o w-func.inst w-func.inst.s 
    $ ./w-func.inst >/dev/null
    $ cat trace.out
